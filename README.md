# Brewin Interpreter ☕️
This project is a Python-based interpreter for Brewin, a custom programming language inspired by the syntax and semantics of C++, Python, and a hint of EMACS Lisp. The goal was to build a fully functional interpreter capable of parsing, evaluating, and executing Brewin code.

I implemented core language features such as variable scoping, control flow, and expression evaluation, all designed to reflect Brewin's hybrid design philosophy.
